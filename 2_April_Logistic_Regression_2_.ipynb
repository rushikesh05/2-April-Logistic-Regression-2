        "###Grid search is a technique in machine learning that helps us find the best hyperparameters for our models. Hyperparameters are settings that we choose before training the model, and they can have a big impact on how well the model performs. For example, if we're using a support vector machine (SVM) model, one of the hyperparameters is the C parameter, which controls how much we penalize misclassifications. Another hyperparameter is the gamma parameter, which controls the width of the kernel function we're using.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Grid search works by trying out different combinations of hyperparameters and evaluating the model's performance on a validation set. The validation set is a subset of the training data that we hold out specifically for this purpose. We can't use the same data that we used for training to evaluate the model's performance, because the model has already seen that data and may have overfit to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "###To perform grid search, we first specify a range of values for each hyperparameter that we want to try out. For example, we might specify a range of values for C and gamma like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "C_range = [0.1, 1, 10]\n",

        "\n",
        "```\n",

        "###This creates a \"grid\" of nine different combinations of C and gamma that we'll try out. For each combination, we'll train a new SVM model with those hyperparameters and evaluate its performance on the validation set. We'll then choose the combination of hyperparameters that gave us the best performance on the validation set.\n",

        "###Grid search can be a computationally expensive process, especially if we're trying out a large number of different hyperparameters or if our dataset is very large.

        "\n",
        "###One benefit of grid search CV is that it guarantees that every possible combination of hyperparameters will be evaluated. This means that it is more likely to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters within the search space. However, the downside is that it can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with a large number of hyperparameters or a large dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Randomized search CV, on the other hand, is faster than grid search CV because it only evaluates a random subset of the possible combinations of hyperparameters. This can be useful when the search space is very large or when there are many hyperparameters to tune. However, the downside is that it does not guarantee that the optimal combination of hyperparameters will be found, and it may miss certain regions of the search space.\n",
